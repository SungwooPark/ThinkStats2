Review of *What's the Chance You will Die to Terrorism?* written by Kevin Zhang

Reviewed by Sung Park

General Feedback:
It seems like there is a slight disconnect between the context provided by the introduction and the questions you are posing. The introduction is describing the rising fear and paranoia toward terrorism, and toward certain ethnic, religious group by some people. The question of what are actual chance of terrorist attack makes sense considering that providing some numerical value will shed light on whether it is something that people should fear about. However, I am not sure how the other question (comparing this statistics to Middle East) addresses the ethnic and religious issue that you raised as a part of your introduction.

It is not clear what the relationship between the Global Terrorism Database and the World Bank Population Database is, and how those data are used in your analysis. Elaborating more on how population data from the World Bank Population Database are relevant to your analysis might be helpful. Also, consider mentioning which agency the databases are from.

In a paragraph interpreting figure 1, this sentence seems little shaky: "In this sense, this result does lend some reasoning to the growing fear of the US people, as it is clear from this graph that terrorists are much more deadly and prevalent in the ME region, so there is a "higher" chance that a given person affiliated with that region might be a terrorist. ". I think there should be more explanation to how the graph associated with this paragraph can lead to a conclusion that a person from ME region might be more likely to be affiliated with that region. Also, this is very sensitive topic so I would be careful stating such a decisive statement like that.

For the paragraph explaining figure 3, I think it's good that you mentioned that the scale on y-axis is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the previous graph but I would be cautious jumping to the conclusion that you drew from this fact.

Overall, good content but some of the materials feel repetitive.

Questions:
1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?

- What is the chance that a given person in the United States region will be the victim of a terrorist attack? How does the number change if a person is in the Middle East?

2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

- The analysis uses the Global Terrorism Database from University of Maryland and the World Bank Population Database.

3) What analyses did the author perform?

- The author extracted the population information from the World Bank Population Databse and the terrorist attack incidents from GTD. He then calculated the per-capita percentage of how many people become a victim of a terrorist attack.

4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

- The analysis provides some answer to the motivating question but not sufficient to fully answer the full scope of the questions posed. For example, the analysis is not quite relevant to the question of whether the paranoia toward certain ethnic/religious group for the fear of a terrorist attack is based on any significant statistical evidence.

5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

- The report achieve a good balance between clarity and engagement but it feels a bit repetitive.

6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?

- I did not spot any siginificant mechanical or formatting error.
