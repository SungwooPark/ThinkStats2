Review of *What's the Chance You will Die to Terrorism?* written by Kevin Zhang

It seems like there is a slight disconnect between the context provided by the introduction and the questions you are posing. The introduction is describing the rising fear and paranoia toward terrorism, and toward certain ethnic, religious group by some people. The question of what are actual chance of terrorist attack makes sense considering that providing some numerical value will shed light on whether it is something that people should fear about. However, I am not sure how the other question (comparing this statistics to Middle East) addresses the ethnic and religious issue that you raised as a part of your introduction.

It is not clear what the relationship between the Global Terrorism Database and the World Bank Population Database is, and how those data are used in your analysis. Elaborating more on how population data from the World Bank Population Database are relevant to your analysis might be helpful.

In a paragraph interpreting figure 1, this sentence seems little shaky: "In this sense, this result does lend some reasoning to the growing fear of the US people, as it is clear from this graph that terrorists are much more deadly and prevalent in the ME region, so there is a "higher" chance that a given person affiliated with that region might be a terrorist. ". I think there should be more explanation to how the graph associated with this paragraph can lead to a conclusion that a person from ME region might be more likely to be affiliated with that region. Also, this is very sensitive topic so I would be careful stating such a decisive statement like that.

For the paragraph explaining figure 3, I think it's good that you mentioned that the scale on y-axis is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the previous graph but I would be cautious jumping to the conclusion that you drew from this fact.

Overall, good content but some of the materials feel repetitive.
