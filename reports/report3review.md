Report 3 Review

The introduction and the title clearly states that the primary motivating question of this report is whether a marital status is a good predictor of a person's political views. The report states that the data come from General Social Survey data from 1987 and 2016. 

The introduction seems to suggest that the authors tried to identify multiple variables that might be a good predictor of a person's poltical views. The report only mentions the marital status as a potential candidate, but I think it would be good to at least mention what other variables the authors explored.

The authors performed a multinominal regression with some control variables (i.e. age and sex). It is not clear whether the authors ran a multinominal regression without control variables in the beginning.

According to the report, the multinominal regression provided a statistically significant result, but p-value is not explicitly stated. I would like to see a numerical value for p-values.

I am not sure how the result of regression provides an answer to the motivating question. This might be a problem of interpretation. What does it mean by change in "apparent effect"? The report does not provide enough context and explanation to help readers understand what the numerical values in  "change in apparent effect" represent.

This report is easy to read but fairly difficult to understand. I think more explanation of the analysis being done and methods employed are necessary.

The quality of presentation is professional, without any apparent grammatical or formatting error.
