# Is There a Seasonality in Number of Likes for Social Media Posts?
## By Sungwoo Park, Olin College of Engineering, Data Science 2017

Using a dataset containing over 4 million facebook posts from 15 mainstream news outlets, I investigate the existence of seasonality in the number of likes a facebook post from a news outlet gets. The dataset contains contents and attributes, such as number of likes and timestamp, of all facebook posts posted by the media sources from 2012 to 2016. The media outlets included in the data are ABC, BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox & Friends, Fox, LA Times, NBC, NPR, The Huffington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Time, and USA Today.
