## Is Terms of Home Mortage Less Favorable Now Compared to That of Pre-subprime Nortagage Crisis in 2007?

It is well known fact that excessive amount of default from subprime mortages, which are mortagages normally issued to a borrower of low credit, was a leading cause of subprime mortagage crisis that led to a global financial meltdown in 2007. Because of this nightmarish experience, it seems plausible to assume that current home mortagages are much harder to get and much more conservative (in terms of risks the lender is taking, shown mainly as an interest rate) than pre-2007 mortagages. Using a dataset containing all home mortagages purchased or guaranteed from The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac, I investigate whether there is any noticeable difference between the interest rates before and after subprime mortgage crisis.
