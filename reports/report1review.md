The primary motivating question of this report is to find which tattoos serve as indicators that a given inmate may have committed a specific crime. The dataset this report uses is from the Florida Department of Corrections. The authors analyzed the dataset by comparing the relative frequencies of crime-tatto pairing relative to the population at large. Specifics of how this analysis was performed isn't included in this report, but this absence of the detailed description might be good for the article's clarity. The analysis provide an answer to the motivating question by presenting a relative difference in percentage tendency to commit a crime of different kinds. This report strike a good balance between a clarity and engagement, and its presentation is professional with absence of grammatical and formatting error.
